# ESP32 Projects
ESP32 mini-projects built with reference to the Freenove C-tutorial.  
  
**Happy Holidays:** Displays "HAPPY HOLIdAYS" on the 7-segment display [Video](https://youtu.be/URAJUHGwx1I). This project was done in reference to "16.2 4-Digit 7-Segment Display". Script was modified to display the desired text and uses counters to imitate sliding text movement across the display.
