# ESP32 Projects
ESP32 mini-projects built with reference to the Freenove C-tutorial guide. Aiming to improve my intuition for hardware. 
  
**Happy Holidays:** Displays "HAPPY HOLIdAYS" on the 7-segment display. A demo can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/URAJUHGwx1I). This project was done in reference to "16.2 4-Digit 7-Segment Display". Script was modified to display the desired text and uses counters to imitate sliding text movement across the display.

**Plant Spot Light Detector:** Uses a photoresistor to check whether a location for placing a plant receives enough light. A demo can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/0cP6xB9Rfj0). This project was done in reference to "12.1 NightLamp" and "20.1 LCD1602".
