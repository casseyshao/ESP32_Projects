# ESP32 Projects
ESP32 mini-projects built with reference to the Freenove C-tutorial guide. Aiming to improve my intuition for hardware. 
  
**Happy Holidays:** Displays "HAPPY HOLIdAYS" on the 7-segment display. A demo can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/URAJUHGwx1I). This project was done in reference to Chapter 16 74HC595 & 7-Segment Display. Script was modified to display the desired text and uses counters to imitate sliding text movement across the display.

**Plant Spot Light Detector:** Uses a photoresistor to check whether a location for placing a plant receives enough light. A demo can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/0cP6xB9Rfj0). This project was done in reference to Chapter 12 Photoresistor & LED and Chapter 20 LCD1602.

**Trespasser Detector:** Uses a HC SR04 ultrasonic ranging module to calculate the distance of an object. If the object is close (i.e., closer than 5 cm), the active buzzer sounds. A demo can be watched [here](https://youtu.be/HzMnT59Ji10). This project was done in reference to Chapter 7 Buzzer and Chapter 21 Ultrasonic Ranging.
